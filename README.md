Project Overview
Richter's Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the level of damage caused to buildings by an earthquake. The goal is to model the severity of building damage using structured data, including geographic, geologic, and structural information.

This project uses various machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, to predict the extent of damage based on features like building characteristics and geographic location.

Dataset
The dataset comes from the DrivenData competition. It contains information about buildings that were impacted by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.

Features: Structural characteristics of the buildings (e.g., building materials, foundation type, etc.).
Target Variable: damage_grade – the level of damage caused by the earthquake, represented as 1 (low damage), 2 (medium damage), or 3 (severe damage).
Files:
train_values.csv: Training dataset features.
train_labels.csv: Training dataset target variable (damage_grade).
test_values.csv: Test dataset features (no target variable).
Problem Statement
The task is to predict the damage_grade of buildings after an earthquake, which is a multi-class classification problem with the following classes:

1: Low damage
2: Medium damage
3: Severe damage
The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict these damage levels based on the building features provided in the dataset.

Step 3: Train the Model
Train the XGBoost model using the processed data:

bash
Copy code
python src/model_training.py
Step 4: Make Predictions
Once the model is trained, use it to make predictions on the test dataset:

bash
Copy code
python src/prediction.py
Modeling Approach
The key steps in building the predictive model include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and handling missing data.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Training: Using XGBoost, a robust and efficient algorithm for structured data, with hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation: Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure model effectiveness in predicting the correct damage class.
Results
Model Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of X% on the test data.
F1-Score: The F1-score for the model across different damage levels is Y.
The model showed good performance, particularly in distinguishing between low and high levels of damage.
